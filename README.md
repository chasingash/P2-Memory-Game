# JUNGLE MEMORY GAME - Project Portfolio 2  - HTML, CSS & JavaScript

Jungle Memory Game is a matching game using custom vector patterns I created in Adobe illustrator. This is a solo player game. It is timed and counts how many moves it takes to find all matching pairs. This mini web game is fully responsive, created with mobile-first in mind.

# Objective

For my second project, I will develop an interactive Front-End web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based on the principles for user experience design, accessibility, and responsivity.


# User Experience (UX)
## Target Audience

## User Stories

## Design Prototype
I designed a prototype for the memory game on paper first and then moved into Balsamiq where I created numerous wireframes to fit mobile, tablet and desktop devices which provided me with a clear visual outline of how I wanted my game to appear. Some changes were made along the development stage as I experimented with different layouts to suit the needs of the game.

## Site Structure

The game is featured on a single-page. 


# Design

* ## Typography
 
Fonts used: Courier New, monospace which I implemented into the CSS file via Google fonts.

* ## Colour Scheme
 
I went for a fresh colour scheme providing plenty of contrast.

* ## Imagery

All imagery was sourced from the website, pexel.com - link site :)

# Features

The ARTSPACE website is set up for easy navigation. It contains a navigation bar, a highlighted contact button when hovered over it flips colour and a call to action button centered in the middle, clearly stating “Find a class” which the user is there to do. The overall feel of the site is intended to be inviting while encouraging the user to explore more. I designed this site with mobile first in mind.

## Existing Features
 
* ### Navigation bar

Located at the top of the website, it allows its users to intuitively navigate the site. It is fully responsive and contains all links to all sections of the site. It is in a fixed position so that it stays visible, whether you scroll down through the page or use the convenient links nested inside the bar. In mobile view, there is a hamburger icon which also has a fixed position and working links.
 
The LOGO is clickable and links back to the homepage. I created it using fonts and css styling.

* ### Homepage section
 
 The homepage has a background image which fits the screen. The image is colourful and playful and gives a good clear direction of what the website is about. This is where the user lands on their initial visit. It is designed to be intuitive and user friendly.
 
 Overlaid on top of the image is where the main header text appears. It states clearly in large text what the site is about.
 
 Above the main header text, is more text in slightly smaller text and in uppercase with a catchy slogan to further draw in the user.
 
 Beneath the Main text is a simple yet effective call-to-action button that directs the user to “Find a class”

* ### Class Information Section

  The Class information section aims to provide the user with the age category, a class description and the day and times for each art class and is fully responsive on all devices.

* ### Contact Section

  The contact form allows for enquiries about its currently run art classes to be sent to the creator.

  The contact section is fully responsive and aligns above the map in mobile view. In larger screens it aligns to the left of the map.

* ## Bug Fixes

* After testing the site on different screen sizes, i discovered some text was not aligned properly which on further investigation appeared to be due to margin and padding issues. 

    I resolved with media queries and ajusting the margin and padding. 

* Another issue i had was with the navigation links not stopping at the right section and catching the fixed navigation bar to cut some of the section of. 

![Chrome Mobile Lighthouse](assets/readme-images/bug.png)

  I resolved this by wrapping the container inside a span element and giving it a unique ID. The i added a relative position to it in css which fixed the issue.
