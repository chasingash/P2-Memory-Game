# JUNGLE MEMORY GAME - Project Portfolio 2  - HTML, CSS & JavaScript

Jungle Memory Game is a matching game using custom vector patterns I created in Adobe illustrator. This is a solo player game. It is timed and counts how many moves it takes to find all matching pairs. This mini web game is fully responsive, created with mobile-first in mind.
