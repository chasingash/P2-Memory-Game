# JUNGLE MEMORY GAME - Project Portfolio 2  - HTML, CSS & JavaScript

Jungle Memory Game is a matching game using custom vector patterns I created in Adobe illustrator. This is a solo player game. It is timed and counts how many moves it takes to find all matching pairs. This mini web game is fully responsive, created with mobile-first in mind.

Memory games help children and Adults alike, to improve focus and concencentration while improving overall mental function.Both short and long-term memory are imprived as well as visual recognition.

# Objective

For my second project, I will develop an interactive Front-End web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based on the principles for user experience design, accessibility, and responsivity.


# User Experience (UX)

### User Stories
  
  ##### First Time Visitor Goals:
  For first time visitors:  
  - Instructions are clearly visible.
  - Engaged with game from the initial onset. 
  - Gameplay is intuitive.
  - To play on various devices and screen sizes. 
  
  ##### Return Visitor Goals:
  For return visitors:  
  - Gauge performance.
  - Play game on various devices.
  
  ##### Website's Owner Goals.
  As the developer:
  - I aim to provide a fun and interactive experience.
  - I aim to encourage continued use of the game.

## Design Prototype
I designed a prototype for the memory game on paper first and then moved into Balsamiq where I created numerous wireframes to fit mobile, tablet and desktop devices which provided me with a clear visual outline of how I wanted my game to appear. Some changes were made along the development stage as I experimented with different layouts to suit the needs of the game.

# Design

* ## Typography
 
Fonts used: Courier New, monospace. It stands out well against the background and is easy to read.

* ## Colour Scheme
 
I played around a lot with different colour schemes and settled on the ones below for their fresh colour feel. while providing plenty of contrast.

* ## Imagery

All illustrations used for the cards are my own original designs that i created in Adobe Illustrator.

### Responsive  Website
  The site displays properly on a wide range of screen sizes. 
  
    Mobile view
  ![Mobile view](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtbdqnrln/image/upload/v1647815506/P2/Screenshot_2022-03-20_at_22.30.55_vdwroq.png) 

    Tablet view

    Desktop view

  ### Instruction Page 
  On loading, the instructions are clearly visible below the game title.(positioning is relative to screen size).
  This satisfies the user need to quickly understand how to play the game.

  ![picture of the instructions](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtbdqnrln/image/upload/v1647812061/P2/Screenshot_2022-03-20_at_21.33.38_gkxpur.png)

  ### Timer
  The time is tracked once the game starts and continues until all pairs are mateched. The timer is placed just below the game board. When the player completes the final pair the time taken as well as how many moves it took to get there is displayed in the modal screen display area. This satisfies the players need to be able to gauge their performancee.  
    
    
  ![a picture of the timer section](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtbdqnrln/image/upload/v1647816279/P2/Screenshot_2022-03-20_at_22.44.34_qrku8c.png)  

  ### Modal Screen
  When all cards are matched, a modal screen is displayed with a congratulatory message and details of the time taken and how many moves it took to complete.  

  ![a picture of the victory screen](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtbdqnrln/image/upload/v1647811709/P2/Screenshot_2022-03-20_at_21.28.14_hokzke.png)

  ### Future Features

  Extra features I'd like to implement
  1. More levels to increse difficulty.
  2. Sound effects to clicked on cards.
  3. More detailed instructions added to a modal with all extra features included.

  <summary>Testing</summary>

* ## Code Validation

* The Jungle Memory Game has been tested and validated by the W3C HTML Validator, the W3C CSS Validator and the JShint validator. All minor errors found were fixed immediately. 

* ### HTML Validation Image

* ### JSHint
  The Javascript file was validated using JSHint, with the following result.  The `New JavaScript features (ES6)` option was ticked in the 
  Configure menu. 
  
  ![a picture of the jshint result](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtbdqnrln/image/upload/v1647819854/P2/Screenshot_2022-03-20_at_23.44.07_buu1ij.png) 

* ### WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool
  The WAVE tool was used to test the page for accessibility.  The inital result produced 8 contrast errors, these were caused by the colour of the ink used for the times  (fushia as a drop shadow behid the green text). I updated the colour to black for the drop shadow and that fixed the issue.
