# JUNGLE MEMORY GAME - Project Portfolio 2  - HTML, CSS & JavaScript

Jungle Memory Game is a matching game using custom vector patterns I created in Adobe illustrator. This is a solo player game. It is timed and counts how many moves it takes to find all matching pairs. This mini web game is fully responsive, created with mobile-first in mind.

# Objective

For my second project, I will develop an interactive Front-End web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based on the principles for user experience design, accessibility, and responsivity.


# User Experience (UX)

### User Stories
  
  ##### First Time Visitor Goals:
  For first time visitors:  
  - Instructions are clearly visible.
  - Engaged with game from the initial onset. 
  - Gameplay is intuitive.
  - To play on various devices and screen sizes. 
  
  ##### Return Visitor Goals:
  For return visitors:  
  - Gauge performance.
  - Play game on various devices.
  
  ##### Website's Owner Goals.
  As the developer:
  - I aim to provide a fun and interactive experience.
  - I aim to encourage continued use of the game.

## Design Prototype
I designed a prototype for the memory game on paper first and then moved into Balsamiq where I created numerous wireframes to fit mobile, tablet and desktop devices which provided me with a clear visual outline of how I wanted my game to appear. Some changes were made along the development stage as I experimented with different layouts to suit the needs of the game.

# Design

* ## Typography
 
Fonts used: Courier New, monospace. It stands out well against the background and is easy to read.

* ## Colour Scheme
 
I played around a lot with different colour schemes and settled on the ones below for their fresh colour feel. while providing plenty of contrast.

* ## Imagery

All illustrations used for the cards are my own original designs that i created in Adobe Illustrator.

The background image is a green coloured leopard seamless pattern created in Adobe Illustrator.

### Responsive  Website
  The site displays properly on a wide range of screen sizes. 
  
    Mobile view
  ![Mobile view](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtbdqnrln/image/upload/v1647815506/P2/Screenshot_2022-03-20_at_22.30.55_vdwroq.png) 

    Tablet view

    Desktop view

  ### Instruction Page 
  On loading, the instructions are clearly visible below the game title.(positioning is relative to screen size).
  This satisfies the user need to quickly understand how to play the game.

  ![picture of the instructions](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtbdqnrln/image/upload/v1647812061/P2/Screenshot_2022-03-20_at_21.33.38_gkxpur.png)

  ### Timer
  The time is tracked once the game starts and continues until all pairs are mateched. The timer is placed just below the game board. When the player completes the final pair the time taken as well as how many moves it took to get there is displayed in the modal screen display area. This satisfies the players need to be able to gauge their performancee.  
    
    
  ![a picture of the timer section](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtbdqnrln/image/upload/v1647816279/P2/Screenshot_2022-03-20_at_22.44.34_qrku8c.png)  

  ### Modal Screen
  When all cards are matched, a modal screen is displayed with a congratulatory message and details of the time taken and how many moves it took to complete.

  ### Future Features

  Extra features I'd like to implement
  1. More levels to increse difficulty.
  2. Sound effects to clicked on cards.
  3. More detailed instructions added to a modal with all extra features included.

* ## Bug Fixes

* After testing the site on different screen sizes, i discovered some text was not aligned properly which on further investigation appeared to be due to margin and padding issues. 

    I resolved with media queries and ajusting the margin and padding. 

* Another issue i had was with the navigation links not stopping at the right section and catching the fixed navigation bar to cut some of the section of. 

![Chrome Mobile Lighthouse](assets/readme-images/bug.png)

  I resolved this by wrapping the container inside a span element and giving it a unique ID. The i added a relative position to it in css which fixed the issue.
